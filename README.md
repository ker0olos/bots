### FAQ

> How are you keeping Fable free?

I'm using serverless for the servers and the database, which is much cheaper to
maintain. If it ever starts hurting my wallet, I will have to _actively_ ask for
support, but <u>no one is getting special rewards for donations</u>, worst-case
I will have to offer cosmetics; **tl;dr Fable will always remain 100% free.**
