I'm using serverless for the servers and the database, which is much cheaper to
maintain. If it ever starts hurting my wallet, I will have to actively ask for
support, but no one is getting special rewards for donations, worst-case I will
have to offer cosmetics; tl;dr Fable will always remain 100% free.
