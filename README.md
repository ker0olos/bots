Fable is a free, open-source _anime_[^1] gacha bot — a simple, powerful Mudae
alternative. Like Mudae, you can pull anime characters. Unlike Mudae, there's no
premiums, and no pay-to-win bullshit.

There's a intuitive system to manage and customize the characters in your
servers, you can add community-made packs that are full of new characters with
single command.

Fable is actively developed with new game modes and features being released.

<!-- You can also overwrite the builtin characters with your own images, aliases, and
descriptions, and fully personalize your characters, that's when you pill them,
of course. -->

[^1]: Currently the default packs include anime/manga/manhwa/vtubers, but you
can add other packs, for example video game characters or real life celebrities.
You can also disable the anime packs entirety (Incase it's a sport server or
something, we try our best to keep the bot itself term naturel).

We recommend that you check
[fable-community/example](https://github.com/fable-community/example), it has a
great quick start guide.

> How are you keeping Fable free?

We're using serverless for the servers and the database, which is much cheaper
to maintain. If it ever starts hurting our wallet, we'll have to actively ask
for support, but no one is getting special rewards for donations, worst-case
we'll have to offer cosmetics; tl;dr Fable will always remain 100% free.
