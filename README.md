Fable is a free, open-source _anime_[^1] gacha bot — a simple, powerful Mudae
alternative. Like Mudae, you can roll anime characters. Unlike Mudae, there's no
premiums, and no pay-to-win bullshit.

There's a intuitive system to manage and customize the characters in your
servers, you can add community-made packs that are full of new characters with
single command.

> **TODO** too much plain text (no one is gonna read all this) we need some
> images and animations
>
> **Note** This README only lists what is already stable, which is so far just
> packs, the game modes and the animations are still being worked on.

<!-- You can also overwrite the builtin characters with your own images, aliases, and
descriptions, and fully personalize your characters, that's when you roll them,
of course. -->

Fable is actively developed with new game modes and features being releasing.

[^1]: Currently the default packs include anime/manga/manhwa/vtubers, but you
can add other packs, for example video game characters or real life celebrities.
You can also disable the anime packs entirety (Incase it's a sport server or
something, we try our best to keep the bot itself term naturel).

> How are you keeping Fable free?

We're using serverless for the servers and the database, which is much cheaper
to maintain. If it ever starts hurting our wallet, we'll have to actively ask
for support, but no one is getting special rewards for donations, worst-case
we'll have to offer cosmetics; tl;dr Fable will always remain 100% free.
