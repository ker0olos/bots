## Development

Fable uses GitHub. The core team will be working directly here. All changes and
plans will be public from the beginning. You can take _part_ in any of _part_ of
the process.

### Issues and feature requests

When opening an issue or a feature request, always make sure to fill the
existing template to the best of your ability.

### Pull requests

When opening a pull request, describe any changes you made as detailed as you
have patience to do. And any thoughts you have about those changes. And if those
changes introduce new code, please try your best to write tests for it, no pull
requests will be merged if it's not tested well, by testing your code, it will
be merged faster.

The core Fable team monitors all pull requests regularly. We try finishing pull
requests even if they are missing things, but help us by keeping pull requests
consistent by following the guidelines above, and answering any questions left
by us.

[^1]: Staring a repo is like voting for a bot on top.gg, and liking a post on
twitter or facebook, it helps get us a spot on some treading pages.

[^2]: A _good first issue_ is a term that refers to beginner-friendly
issues/features that can help new people who are unfamiliar with open-source
make their first contributions.
