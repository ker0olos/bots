  <h4>Stealing</h4>
  When all negotiations fails, it's fine to take what you want by force, right? Steal characters from that one annoying server member that refuses to trade.

#### **Frequently Asked Questions**

</br>

---

</br>

<details><summary>How can I limit Fable to 1 channel?</summary>
<p>

Go to **Server Settings** then **Integrations** then **Fable**\
From there you can control the permissions globally or even per command.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Can I use prefixes like $ or @Fable?</summary>
<p>

**No**. Fable was built from the ground up to **only** support slash commands.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>How are you keeping Fable free?</summary>
<p>

I'm experienced, I know how to keep my billing very low, and without affecting
server performance.

Some people think I plan to bait and switch after gaining enough popularity, but
Fable is 100% open-source and under MIT license, so even if I suddenly switch to
the dark side, people can take the code, make everything free again and
re-release Fable.
