Fable is a free, open-source gacha bot â€” a simple, powerful Mudae alternative.
Like Mudae, you can pull anime characters. Unlike Mudae, there are no premiums
and no pay-to-win bullshit.

There's an intuitive system to manage and customize the characters in your
servers, like adding extensions to chrome and installing apps on your phone, you
can install community-made packs that are full of new characters with a single
command.

You can try an online demo of Fable before adding it to your server by going to
<https://fable.deno.dev>

Fable is actively developed with new game modes and features frequently.

## FAQ

<details><summary>How can I limit Fable to 1 channel?</summary>
<p>

Go to **Server Settings** then **Integrations** then **Fable**\
From there you can control the permissions globally or even per command.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Can I use prefixes like `$`?</summary>
<p>

**No**. Fable was built from the ground up to only support slash commands,
prefixes are an entirely different thing that requires the bot to manually
monitor all incoming messages in a server. We won't add prefixes to Fable, but
you can go tell discord to add custom prefixes to "slash" commands instead of
"/" for all bots.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>How can I install a new pack on my server?</summary>
<p>

We plan to have a `/marketplace` command where you can browse and install
popular packs but since Fable is still new a there ain't that many people making
packs, You will have to join our discord to manually check the packs currently
available. Then install them by running
`/packs install github: https://github.com/username/packname`

> `Manage Server` permission is required to install packs on "your" server

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>How can I create a new pack?</summary>
<p>

Currently, it's only possible through editing JSON files. Please visit check
[fable-community/example](https://github.com/fable-community/fable-pack-example),
it includes most of the info you need.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>How to uninstall a pack from my server?</summary>
<p>

Use `/packs community` or `/packs uninstall id: pack-id`.
